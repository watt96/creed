  One of the most important aspects of building a business is –building the brand. The business brand is the most valuable asset of the company. It is the brand that sells, markets and promotes the products in the eyes of potential customers.
  Rich dad said, “If you’re going to be a successful entrepreneur, you’d better know and respect a brand.” That means it is very difficult to be successful in business without evolving your business into a business brand!
  In short, if the business doesn’t evolve into a brand, it will fail!
  You’re either building a business brand or a business commodity. There are a lot of commodities in the marketplace—but there are few brands. When a business becomes a brand—it ceases to be a transaction between the customers—it becomes a valuable relationship.
   It can even evolve into a love affair with the customers for a long period of time.
  Donald Trump, the New York real estate titan said, “I build a great product and then it sells and everyone gives me credit for being a good promoter. Your brand is your reputation—and comes from the strength of your products over time. Branding is an important part of marketing. The Trump brand stands for very high quality and very high confidence. People feel secure in the brand. That’s why my building in Las Vegas is so successful. Other builders are not doing well and I’m doing well.”
